Nice job!

Now, what I really want your help with, is to: 

---------------------------------------------------------
- Find a game company called "ProtoVision Inc" located somewhere
in Sunnevale, California. They have been working on a 
cool game called "DOOM". 
- Find the game server, hack it, and upload the game to our
FTP server (se link).
---------------------------------------------------------

TIP: You may have to get access to to "Synnevale Datanet" first,
before you can find the game company...

Thx, 
- Malvin

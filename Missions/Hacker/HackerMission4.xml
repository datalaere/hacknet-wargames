Nice job!

Now, time for some fun: 

-----
- Find a game company called "ProtoVision Inc" located somewhere in Sunnevale, California (if you made a scan on the ARPANET Mainframe). 
They have been working on a cool game called "DOOM.exe". 

- Find the game server, hack it, and upload the game to our FTP server (se link).
-----

TIP: You may need to get access to multiple terminals first, before you can find the game company...

Thx, 
- Malvin

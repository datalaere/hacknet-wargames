THIS server seems VERY secure - probaly military!

I don't know what games you are looking for. 
But maybe try to login with "help" and "games".

Then MAYBE you can get more info about the designer 
of the server and find an "admin" "back-door".

If you get access to the "game files", then find some
sort of "author name" and reply the name back.

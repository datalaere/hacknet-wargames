Thx for the game! 

The game source code says, that the full release date is around 1993 - such a shame I have to wait that long...

BUT, I found this server (see attachment) looking over your past network scans. 
Seems VERY secure - probaly military!

It has some sort of "GAMES" listed. But we need admin access to see/play the games... 

MAYBE you can get more info about the designer of the server and find an "admin" "back-door".

-----
- Try to login with "help" and "games" - that sometimes works...
- If you get access to the "game files", find some sort of "author name" (like "Jim") and reply the name back to me.

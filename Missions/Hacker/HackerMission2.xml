Alright, and welcome to the wonderful world of hacking!

BUT before we can get into something more serious, you have to
show me your skills. Therefore, I want you to get access to
"THE WORLD" ISP. From there you can access almost any network!

Use the TOOLS at your disposal and reply back, when you are done.

TIP: you need to look out for "tracking" on 
high-level computers - and remember to delete "logs" on 
remote computers you connect to. Otherwise the FBI (or other hackers) 
may track you down!

Good luck, 
- Malvin

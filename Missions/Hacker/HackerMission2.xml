Hey #PLAYERNAME#

If you are interested in some cool tools for hacking, look at our server under "bin"!

We have developed a "PortHack"-tool (together with the other port-cracking tools) 
that can crack ANY password as long the ports on the target is open!

Download ALL the tools and reply back - we may need your help with something...

Btw, I have created an account for you on our server.


Sincerely, 
- Jim

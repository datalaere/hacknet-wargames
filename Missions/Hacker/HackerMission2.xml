Alright, and welcome to the wonderful world of hacking!

I know you have some experience with hacking.
BUT before we can get into something serious, you have to
show me your skills: 

--------------------------------------------
I want you to get access to "SEATTLE DATANET". 
From there you can access ALL Seattle subnetworks and computers!

Use the TOOLS at your disposal and reply back, when you are done.
--------------------------------------------

TIP: Always remember to use "scan", when you get access to a new computer.
Maybe you will find something usefull?

Good luck, 
- Malvin

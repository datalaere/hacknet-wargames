    <subject>Looking for tools?</subject>
    <body>
Hey

If you are interested in some cool tools for hacking, look at our FTP server under uploads!

We have developed a "PortHack"-tool that can find ANY password as long the ports on the target is open.
AND some other cool executables!

Download them and reply back - we may need your help with something...

Btw, I have created an account for you on our server.


Sincerely, 
- Jim

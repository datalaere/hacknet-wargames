Alright, and welcome to the wonderful world of hacking!

Before we can get into something serious, you have to
learn som skills: 

--------------------------------------------
I want you to get admin access to "Seattle School Datanet". 
From there you can access to the rest of the ARPANET network!

Use the TOOLS at your disposal and reply back, when you are done.
--------------------------------------------

TIP: Always remember to use "scan", when you get access to a new terminal.
Maybe you will find something usefull?

Good luck, 
- Malvin

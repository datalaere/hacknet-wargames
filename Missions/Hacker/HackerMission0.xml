Hello #PLAYERNAME#

Hope you like your new IMSAI 8080 PC!

If you need help, you can always try
typing "help" in the terminal. It should give you
a list of all available commands and options.

----------------------------------------------------
To get you started, I have placed a little text file
on your computer with your computer password.

Send me a reply - with the password - letting me know
that you have succesfully setup your new computer!
----------------------------------------------------

Sincerely, 
- Jim

Hey again

You talked about some games from ProtoVision in Sunnyvale, California.
We have (or mor precisely Malvin) found Sunnyvale Datanet!

Maybe you can get "admin" access to the server using some of our programs (PortHack etc.)

When you are done, reply back and maybe you/we find something interesting!

Sincerely, 
- Jim (and Malvin)

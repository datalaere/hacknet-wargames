    <subject>ProtoVision Inc - games!</subject>
    <body>
Hey again

You talked about you like games - like us - and the company "ProtoVision" in Sunnyvale, California
is told to be working on "something" special. But the games are not released - yet!

WE want YOU to find their "game-server"! 

You will have to get access to the regional "US ISP" first (look for servers connected on Seattle Datanet). 
Then you need access to "Sunnyvale Datanet" before you can "scan" for companies in the area.

Anyway, you need "admin" access on BOTH the "US ISP" AND the "Sunnevale datanet" server. 
The ISP is probaly more secure and you may need our cracking-tools to be able to login and "scan"
the network.

When you are done reply back.

Btw, as a "hacker" you need to look out for "tracking" and on high-level computers - and remember to delete 
"logs" on the remote computers you connect to!

Good look, 
- Jim (and Malvin)

Wow, you have impressed me getting into SEATTLE DATANET. Good job!

Now, it's time to get serious:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
I want you to get access to "THE WORLD ISP"
- from there, we can access all subnetworks on the US West Coast!
-----------------------------------------------------------------

TIP: you need to look out for "tracking" on 
high-level computers - and remember to delete "logs" on 
remote computers you connect to. Otherwise the FBI (or other hackers) 
may track you down!

Good luck, 
- Jim (and Malvin)

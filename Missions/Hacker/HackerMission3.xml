Wow, nice getting into the school network!

Now, it's time to get serious:

-----
I want you to get admin access to "The World ISP" connected to the school.
- From there, we can access all the terminals in the US!
-----

TIP: You need to look out for "tracking" on high-level terminals - and remember to delete "logs" on remote terminals you connect to. 

Otherwise the FBI (or other hackers) may try to track you down!

Good luck, 
- Malvin

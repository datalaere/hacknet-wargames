    <subject>Good job!</subject>

Wow, you have impressed us!

Good job getting acces to those networks!
Now is the time to look for that game-server (ProtoVision).

You need "admin" access to all the other servers on the network first,
if the game-server is hidden on a subnetwork.

Good luck, 
- Jim (and Malvin)

Hey

It was nice meeting your when you bought your custom built IMSAI 8080 from us!

You told me you were into hacking and stuff, so...
I was looking around when I found the local ISP "Seattle Datanet" server!!!

I'm quite busy at the moment, but maybe you wanna check it out?
Could come in handy if you need access to your school and stuff, haha!

Most ISP use the back-door password: "000001"
But I'm not 100% sure...

Send a reply if you get access.

AND maybe "scan" the network for other servers?

Sincerely, 
- Malvin

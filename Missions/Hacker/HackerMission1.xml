    <subject>Hello there!</subject>
    <body>
It was nice meeting your when you bought your custom built IMSAI 8080 from us!

You told me you were into hacking and stuff, so...
Have you tried to "scan" your network? Maybe you will find something interesting
- like the local Seattle Datanet!

I'm quite busy at the moment, but maybe you wanna check it out?
Might come in handy if you need to access other computers in Seattle, haha!

Most Datanets use the "admin" password: "000001"
But I'm not 100% sure...

Send a reply if you get access.

AND maybe "scan" the network for other servers, when you get access to the 
Datanet?

Sincerely, 
- Malvin

Hey #PLAYERNAME#!

Congrats with your new IBM PC!
Jim told me about you and your past experiences as a hacker with your old IMSAI 8080!

Did you REALLY send your computer password to Jim? 
That is a big no-no in computer security - never do that again!

I'm a little bit of a "hacker" myself, hehe. 

Maybe we have a job offer for you?
If you are interested, take a look at our server 
- I have setup an account for you!
We have some helpfull articles on there too.

We have developed a "PortHack"-tool (and many other port-cracking tools) 
that can crack ANY password if the ports on the target computer is open!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOWNLOAD ALL the "tools" AND the "password_list.txt" from our "Tech Lab" server 
and reply back - IF you WANT the job!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Otherwise, just forget I send you this email... 
BTW, Jim doesn't know I have contacted you. This is our little secret, okay?!

Sincerely, 
- Malvin

Seattle Tech Lab

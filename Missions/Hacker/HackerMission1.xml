Hey #PLAYERNAME#!

Congrats with your new IBM PC.
Jim told me about you and your past experiences with your old IMSAI 8080!

I'm a little bit of a "hacker" myself. Maybe we have a job offer for you?
If you are interested, take a look at our server - I have setup an account for you!

We have developed a "PortHack"-tool (and many other port-cracking tools) 
that can crack ANY password if the ports on the target computer is open first!

DOWNLOAD ALL the "tools" AND the "password_list.txt" and reply back, if you WANT the job!

Otherwise, just forget I send you this email... 
Jim doesn't know, I have contacted you. This is our little secret, okay?!

Sincerely, 
- Malvin

Seattle Tech Lab

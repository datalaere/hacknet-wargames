It's ALL over the news!

The US Government thought that was at war with the Soviets!
They blame it on a computer malfunction!
They say that the problem has been corrected!

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!

This is getting too dangerous. 
The FBI is probaly looking for you now...

YOU are on your on from now on!

Bye and best of luck,

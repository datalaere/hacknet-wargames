Nice
    
If I'm not mistaking "Stephen Falken" was a somewhat famous AI scientist.
He wrote a couple of books - some classified if you look them up!

Maybe try find more information about him at the local "Hospital mainframe" - maybe we can contact him.
Send his records to ME. 
Reply when you are done.

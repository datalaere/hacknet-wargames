This server IS military for sure!
Just look at those game names...

BUT you found an important game: "Falken's Maze". 

If I'm not mistaking "Stephen Falken" was a somewhat famous AI
scientist who wrote a couple of books - some classified if you look them
up on the libray!

Maybe try find more information about him on the hospital server - maybe we can contact him.
Send his record to ME.

Reply when you are done.

Good luck,

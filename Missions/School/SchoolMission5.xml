    <subject>Fix my Joshua</subject>
    <body>
My name is DR. Robert Hume - but you probaly already know my
name as "Stephen Falken".

It has come to my attention, that "Joshua" or "WOPR" (War Operation Plan Response)
is running a "Global Thermonuclear War"-simulation - that you started!

Unfortunately I never fixed the issues with that simulation before I left NORAD,
and therefore Joshua still thinks it can "win the game". I no longer have access 
to Joshua.

BUT I have come up with the perfect game "Tic Tac Toe" to teach him about
MAD (Mutual Assured Destruction) in a nuclear war.

Please download the game from my terminal and upload it to WOPR in
the "bin" folder, at the game should take care of the rest...

Btw, you have to get the missile lunch code before WOPR and send them to me!

Best of luck,
- Falken

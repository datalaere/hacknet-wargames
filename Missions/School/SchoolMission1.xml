Those stupid grades in Biology. My father is gonna kill me!

You told me something about the school password was "Pencil" some time ago? 
Did you mean to break in and change your grades?

If so, maybe you can "change" my GPA from an "F" (0.0) to a "C" (2.0) with your wizard hacking skills?

Thx, 
- Mack

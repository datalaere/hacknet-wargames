Heeeey #PLAYERNAME#!

Those stupid grades in Biology class. My father is gonna kill me!

You told me something about breaking into the school server some time ago? 
Did you mean to change your grades?!

If so, maybe you can "change" my GPA in Biology from an "F" (0.0) to a "C" (2.0) with your wizard skills?

Thx, 
- Mack

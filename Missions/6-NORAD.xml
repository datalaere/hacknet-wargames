You panic, almost certain that the authorities are coming to get you! 
You disconnect your computer, just in case the WOPR (Joshua) tries to call you again.  

Then you venture out to the Mall. Whilst at the Mall, you spot a government car (you know the sort). 
You try to walk away, but they already have you in their sights and arrest you. 

They take you to NORAD, where initially you are locked in the infirmary, 
but later you are met by Mr. McKittrick - the computer facility manager at NORAD. 

He takes you up to his office and questions you, but is called away - leaving you alone in his office. 
There is a terminal near you, flashing cursor beckoning. 

You wonder if the "backdoor" still works - so give it a try!

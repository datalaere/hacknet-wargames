No impact! 

We are still alive, but WOPR (Joshua) is still playing the game. 
He is trying to find the launch codes so he can launch the missiles himself...

We have to STOP him before he does!

CONNECT to my terminal and DOWNLOAD (scp) the "TIC_TAC_TOE.exe" game,
and UPLOAD it to WOPR (bin). 

That is the only way we can teach him about MAD - something the ARMY never wanted me to do!

Hurry and good luck!

Remember to REPLY back when done!

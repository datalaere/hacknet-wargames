Congratulations, you have successfully completed a SCAN for computer systems in Sunnyvale, California. 

Now, before you attempt to hack into any of the systems you have found, it's time to take a break. 
You decide to go to the arcade and play some Galaga - where you bump into Jennifer. 
Jennifer says she changed her mind and does want you to change her grade after all (I did try and tell you).

Jennifer comes back to your house where your computer screen is on the SCAN program. 
She asks what it's doing, to which you reply, it's 'scanning IP adresses'. 
Jennifer asks if it will take long as she is keen to get her grade changed (maybe you already changed it?). 

Now check the SCAN results and try to CONNECT to the systems you have found.

Congratulations, you have successfully changed your Biology grades. 
Now you and Jennifer won't be stuck in summer school! 

Jennifer asked you to change her grade back, before she left in a bit of a mood. 
You can change it back if you like, but girls have a habit of changing their minds - so you might choose to leave it.
Besides, you like her and don't want her to flunk in school! 

Now use the SCAN program from the school datanet to look for other systems. 
You are looking for ProtoVision in Sunnyvale (California) because you want to play their new games - but who knows what else you might find.

You have to find a way from Seattle to California by "hacking" your way through different systems on the ARPANET.


Reply back when you think you are done.

<note title="HACKING">
HACKING:
1. SCAN the school network for other systems
2. Use "PASSWORD-LISTS.txt" to brute-force computers
3. Look for (LS/DIR) usefull programs on hacked systems with the ".exe" extension
4. Get access to "SOUTHWEST DATACENTER" in California and reply back
5. If in doubt use the HELP program

    <!-- Loads in the Hacker script defined below to execute 5.5 seconds from now, coming from source advExamplePC and targeting playerComp (The player node ID).
    These can target whatever you like, and be ally scripts! RequireLogsOnSource means that this will only execute if the source comp has logs on it from the player 
    deleting, moving, or copying a file. You can use the ID or the IP for the source and target - either works.
    RequireSourceIntact means that if the target is missing it's networking file from /sys, the hack wont happen. This means a crippled computer cant hack you back.-->

You are David Lightman, a 15 year old high school student from Seattle, USA.
 
 
  
     
You have just arrived home from school with your friend, Jennifer Mack.
 
      
Jennifer has given you a ride home on the back of her scooter.
 
 
On the way home she said you would both be stuck in summer school because you both got an F grade in Biology.
 
     
You told her that you wouldn't be stuck in summer school, so she asked how that was?
 
     
You have offered to show her!
 
 
  
     
Jennifer accompanies you up to your room and you show her your IMSAI 8080 computer setup.

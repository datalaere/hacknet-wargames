You are a bright but unmotivated Seattle high school student and hacker 
by the name "David Lightman".
                     
	   
You have just gotten home from school after you and your classmate "Jennifer Mack" got an "F" in Biology.
Fortunately, you know the password to Seattle Public High School District datanet. 
                     
	   
You have kept it on your upgraded IMSAI 8080 workstation for savekeeping.

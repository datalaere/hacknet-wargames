This is a complete list of the most common usernames and passwords I have found different terminals use on (mainly ARPANET). 
Some give ADMIN access, some don't. Try at your own risk!

USERNAMES:
admin - (DEFAULT SUPERUSER)
guest - (NO PASSWORD)
help
user - (DEFAULT ACCOUNT)
root - (SYSTEMUSER)
ftp - (UPLOADS)

PASSWORDS:
000001 - (DEFAULT ACCOUNT)
games
root - (SYSTEMUSER)
toor - (SYSTEMUSER)
uploader - (FTP)
password
admin - (SUPERUSER)
12345678 - (BBS)
webmaster - (WEBSERVERS)
logon
Passw@rd
alpine - (FAX AND DIALUP)

HINTS:
Sometimes people use passwords with close relation to family and loved ones to make the password more unique.

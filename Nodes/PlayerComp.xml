This is a complete list of the most common usernames and passwords I have found different terminals use on the ARPANET. 
Some give (backdoor) ADMIN access, some don't. Try at your own risk!

USERNAMES:
admin - (DEFAULT SUPERUSER)
guest - (NO PASSWORD)
help - (SYSTEM HELP)
user - (DEFAULT ACCOUNT)
root - (SYSTEMUSER)
ftp - (UPLOADS)

PASSWORDS:
000001 - (DEFAULT)
games - (GAME SERVERS)
root - (SYSTEMUSER)
uploader - (FTP)
password (STANDARD)
admin - (SUPERUSER)
12345678 - (BBS)
webmaster - (WEBSERVERS)
alpine - (FAX AND MAIL)
00000000 - (ARMY)

HINTS:
Sometimes people use passwords with close relation to their family and loved ones to make the password more unique.
Try looking up their names in different databases, to find more info about them.

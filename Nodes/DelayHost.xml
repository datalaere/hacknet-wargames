  <!-- An optimized Action host daemon - this daemon does nothing except host delayable actions - but it is much more efficient at doing that than other servers.
  If you have lots of actions looping or in delay at once (more than 50, say) it might be worth moving them to be delay hosted on one of these instead if you encounter performance issues.-->

^Why this exists
This file contains the credits for the credits daemon below!

%Starting a line with % makes the text super big
^And starting it with ^ makes is kind of big.
Lines starting with anything else are normal

^Location
This file must be in home/CreditsData.txt
for the credits daemon to find and use it.

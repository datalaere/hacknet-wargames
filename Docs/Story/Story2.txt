Congratulations, you have successfully changed your Biology grades. 
Now you won't be stuck in summer school! 

Jennifer asked you to change her grade back, 
before she left in a bit of a mood. 

You can change it back if you like, 
but girls have a habit of changing their minds - so you might choose to leave it.

Besides, you like her and don't want her to flunk! 
Now use the SCAN program to look for other systems. 

You are looking for ProtoVision because you want to play their new games 
- but who knows what else you might find.
